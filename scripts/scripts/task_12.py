Petya and Katya are brother and sister. 
Petya is a student, and Katya is a schoolgirl. 
Petya helps Katya with math. 
He thinks of two natural numbers X and Y (X,Yâ‰¤1000), 
and Katya has to guess them. 
To do this, Petya makes two clues. 
He calls the sum of these numbers S and their product P. 
Help Katya guess numbers conceived by Petya.
